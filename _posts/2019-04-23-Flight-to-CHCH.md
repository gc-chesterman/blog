Today i am moving back to Christchurch for the rest of the term. It was nice being home over Easter however I have some work that needs completing and home isn't the best place to complete this. Over the break I did a lot of research into website creation, plain text editors and their conversion to standard formats and graphing in python.

I also began doing some basic data processing of data for the farm. This was very nice to do as it was both relevent to what I have been researching, helped mum out and earned some $$. The graphing was simple but the code took some time to write. Now that the code is written I will be able to easily execute it when new similar data is needing to be pocessed. Additionally through writing the code I have also been able to build up my bank of code snippets and experience. Using hat I learnt from doing these graphs I rewrote the code for my ENME303 assignment to be more efficient and to utilize a combination of dictionaries and list over the previous version that utilized a class structure for each file. I believe this improved the efficientcy of the code and also made it easier to add the simulation code into the script. It did provide some headaches however as I forgot to convert the x values into floats therefore in graphing their was a time and memory issue. After a couple hours I discovered the issue and there were no problems after this.

So far I have included the following packages for writing the markdown text:

1. wordcount
2. zen
3. language-latex
4. language-markdown
5. markdown-preview-plus
6. markdown-writer
7. pdf-preview

I have only just started using zen and wordcount though I see that they will be beneficial in staying on track with what I am doing. The soft-wrap setting is a necessity in zen and the typewriter configuration in centering the line being worked on seems interesting but good.

Last night I also watched some videos on r markdown and the r language. I did not get into that much detail though fro what I saw r is similar if not a direct alternative to python. However, there seems to be some additional linkage to r markdown which would be nice if I continue with markdown. Presently though I see no need to switch over as in dong so I would have to fully learn another similar language. It may be worth looking into in the future though.
