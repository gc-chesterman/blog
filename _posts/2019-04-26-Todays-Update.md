Procrastination is a great motivator for the tasks that you do have to immediately finish. Over the last few days I have completed the basic html and css for my blog site, completed some analysis for the family farm on the lots for this years sale, and seen Avengers Endgame (great movie by the way). The motivation for all of this, as stated, was procrastinating the uni work I have to finish.

In terms of uni work I have tasks for three of my four subjects.

1. Firstly, and most importantly for ENME303 I have to complete my PID report. For this I have completed my graphs and just need to actually write the report. This would be my first report using markdown as my main text editor and then exporting to word using pandoc. Thus creating an additional area of procrastination, investigating the pandoc styling dependencies. For this subject I also have to watch ~8 hours of lectures, yay!
2. The second lot of work I have to complete is for ENME409, physiological modelling. The work isn't directly graded however we were asked to observe the response change of the neurons with particular variable changes. For this we are given MATLAB and just have to play around with it. To this from home I will have to use the remote desktop which I despise.
3. The final bit of work is watching lectures or ENME301 and looking at the bearing assignment which is due at the end of the term.
